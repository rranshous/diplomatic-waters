      "message": "As representatives of Tuvana, we appreciate your efforts to mediate this water crisis. However, we must express concerns about Article 2's provisions which could constrain our sovereign right to operate the dam according to our domestic needs. The term 'reasonable water flow' lacks precise quantification, making implementation challenging. We suggest defining specific cubic meters per second rather than subjective terminology. Additionally, we cannot accept external monitoring at our dam facility as proposed in Article 4 without significant modifications to protect our national security interests."

      "from": "Alaria",
      "message": "The government of Alaria acknowledges receipt of your draft treaty. While we appreciate the attempt to address water allocation, this draft lacks the specific guarantees our agricultural sector requires to function. Our irrigation systems need precise water volumes delivered on predictable schedules. The current language referring to 'equitable distribution' provides insufficient certainty for our farmers to plan crop cycles. We require minimum guaranteed flow rates with clear timetables. Furthermore, the absence of compensation mechanisms for crop losses resulting from upstream actions is a significant oversight that must be addressed."

      "message": "Meridian welcomes this initiative to address the water crisis affecting our region. However, we must emphasize that the current draft lacks enforceable mechanisms to ensure compliance. Without clear consequences for treaty violations, we fear upstream nations may prioritize their interests during peak drought periods. Additionally, water quality standards are entirely absent from this agreement - a critical concern for our urban water supply. We would also like to see provisions addressing sediment management, as irregular dam operations have significantly impacted water treatment costs in our cities. We look forward to a revised draft addressing these concerns."
